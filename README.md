# 😃 Emotion Detection from Text (Sentiment Classification)

This project performs **emotion classification** on text data using multiple machine learning models. The goal is to detect and categorize emotions expressed in textual data (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.). The notebook also includes **text cleaning**, **keyword extraction**, and **visualization techniques**.

## 📚 Project Overview

This is a full **text classification pipeline** for detecting emotions in short text samples. The project includes:

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Text cleaning (stopwords, emojis, punctuations)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF / Bag of Words)
- Keyword analysis and word clouds
- Model training using ML algorithms
- Performance comparison between models
